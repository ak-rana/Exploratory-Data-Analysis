# Hi, I'm Akanksha! ðŸ‘‹
#### Little about me :)
I am a third-year business administration undergraduate. This repository is a collection of my Python assignments where I have explored the world of data visualization and modeling using popular libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Through these assignments, I have gained a deeper understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques.

## About My Repository
Welcome to my repository of Python assignments. In my assignments, I explored different datasets and applied various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data. I also used machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees to predict outcomes and understand the relationships between variables.

Overall, these assignments have provided me with hands-on experience in using Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. I hope that this repository will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about data visualization and modeling using Python.

- Softwares Used in this Repository
- Lessons




### Major Project (go-through)
i. Class 06 - Assignment (Teleco_Churn-EDA-Decision Tree Classifier)

ii. Class 07 - Assignment (melb_data-EDA-Decision Tree Regressor)

iii. Class 08 - Assignment (University_Rank-EDA Matplotlib)

iv. Class 09 - Assignment (Customer_Churn-EDA-Decision Tree Classifier)
### i. Class 06 - Assignment 

EDA & fitting Decision Tree Model - The project I worked on involved using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a decision tree model classifier to predict customer churn in a telecommunication company. The dataset used in this project was the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contained information about customers' demographics, usage patterns, and account information.

### ii. Class 07 - Assignment

EDA & Decision Tree Regressor - The project I worked on involved using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a decision tree model regressor to predict housing prices in Melbourne, Australia. The dataset used in this project was the Melbourne Housing Market dataset, which contained information about housing prices and various features of the properties.

Here I also developed a function that takes in the features of a property and uses the trained model to predict its price. This function can be used to get a quick estimate of the value of a property based on its features.![gif](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5f89479830959ed34b1bcb502c860f4598856943fe9516c1354f0cbf2ec7480f/68747470733a2f2f69302e77702e636f6d2f76757363692e626c6f672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30312f62616e6e65722d666f722d61727469636c652d322e6a70673f6669743d313538382532433631302673736c3d3173313630302f323030305f36303070782e676966)


### Class 08 - Assignment
EDA in Matplotlib only - The project I worked on involved using exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the University Ranking dataset using the Matplotlib library. The dataset contained information about various universities around the world, including their rankings, scores on different criteria, and other relevant attributes.

To begin, I used Matplotlib to create various visualizations to explore the dataset and gain insights into the relationships between different variables. I created scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to visualize the distribution of different attributes and their relationships with other variables.

 The insights gained from this project can be used to inform decisions about university rankings and help identify areas for improvement in different universities.![gif](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/276329498/44f65a80-bb8d-11ea-9a5e-d85b64e377ee)
## Class 09 - Assignment
The project I worked on involved using exploratory data analysis (EDA), a decision tree model classifier, and encoding techniques to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. The dataset used in this project was the Customer Churn dataset, which contained information about customers' demographics, usage patterns, and account information.

This project provides a practical application of EDA, encoding techniques, and decision tree classification techniques in the context of customer churn prediction, which is a common problem faced by telecommunication companies. The insights gained from this project can be used to develop targeted strategies to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
## Lessons Learned

Throughout the various assignments that you completed in Jupyter Notebook, there are several valuable lessons that can be learned:

--The importance of data cleaning: Many of the assignments involved cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis. This process is crucial as it ensures that the data is accurate and consistent, which is essential for producing meaningful insights.

--The value of exploratory data analysis (EDA): EDA is a critical step in data analysis as it helps to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers in the data. This process can uncover valuable insights that may not be apparent through simple summary statistics.

--The power of visualization: Visualizations are an essential tool for exploring and presenting data. They can be used to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the data, making it easier to communicate insights to others.

--The importance of model selection and evaluation: In machine learning, selecting the right model for the data is critical. It's also essential to evaluate the model's performance accurately to ensure that it's effective at predicting outcomes.

--The usefulness of encoding techniques: Encoding techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding can help prepare the data for modeling, improving the accuracy of the results.

Overall, these assignments have provided practical experience in data analysis, modeling, and visualization, demonstrating the importance of these skills in real-world applications. By understanding these concepts, you can effectively analyze data, draw valuable insights, and develop effective strategies based on the findings
